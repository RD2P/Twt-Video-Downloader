# Twt-Video-Downloader

This project is a Python script that uses Selenium and requests to download videos from Twitter.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* Selenium
* MS Edge webdriver
* Requests
* tkinter

## How to use
1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Download the MS Edge webdriver and place it in a folder of your choice.
3. Clone or download the script from this repository.
4. Run the script from the command line or from a Python IDE.

Upon running the script, a pop-up window will appear asking for the Twitter link of the video to download. Once the link is entered, the script will automate the process of navigating to a video downloader website, inputting the link, and clicking the download button. After the video has been downloaded, it will be saved in the project's "Downloads" folder and the folder will open automatically.
